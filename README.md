# Math facts - for kids
This is a quick CLI app I put together for my 3rd grader to practice multiplication time tests.
Maybe you have a kid who needs to practice multiplication too!

## Usage
`./match-facts` Has one option of `-l` for the length of the test in seconds. Defaualt is '60' if the length '-l' option is not provided. 

## Example Run
```
> ./math-facts
9 * 3 = 36
5 * 4 = 20
7 * 6 = 42
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 8 = 16
2 * 6 = 12
6 * 5 = 30
1 * 5 = 5
3 * 8 = 24
0 * 7 = 0
9 * 9 = 81
8 * 0 = 0
4 * 0 = 0
3 * 7 = 21
4 * 8 = 32
7 * 3 = 21
3 * 7 = 21
2 * 7 = 14
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 2 = 12
1 * 4 = 4
1 * 5 = 5
1 * 1 = 1
2 * 3 = 6
9 * 9 = 81
7 * 0 = 0
7 * 5 = 35
5 * 8 = 40
Times up!
